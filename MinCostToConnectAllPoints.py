# You are given an array points representing integer coordinates of some points on a 2D-plane, where points[i] = [xi, yi].

# The cost of connecting two points [xi, yi] and [xj, yj] is the manhattan distance between them: |xi - xj| + |yi - yj|, where |val| denotes the absolute value of val.

# Return the minimum cost to make all points connected. All points are connected if there is exactly one simple path between any two points.

 

# Example 1:


# Input: points = [[0,0],[2,2],[3,10],[5,2],[7,0]]
# Output: 20
# Explanation: 

# We can connect the points as shown above to get the minimum cost of 20.
# Notice that there is a unique path between every pair of points.
# Example 2:

# Input: points = [[3,12],[-2,5],[-4,1]]
# Output: 18
 

# Constraints:

# 1 <= points.length <= 1000
# -106 <= xi, yi <= 106
# All pairs (xi, yi) are distinct.
