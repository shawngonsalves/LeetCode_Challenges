# Given string num representing a non-negative integer num, and an integer k, return the smallest possible integer after removing k digits from num.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: num = "1432219", k = 3
# Output: "1219"
# Explanation: Remove the three digits 4, 3, and 2 to form the new number 1219 which is the smallest.
# Example 2:

# Input: num = "10200", k = 1
# Output: "200"
# Explanation: Remove the leading 1 and the number is 200. Note that the output must not contain leading zeroes.
# Example 3:

# Input: num = "10", k = 2
# Output: "0"
# Explanation: Remove all the digits from the number and it is left with nothing which is 0.
 

# Constraints:

# 1 <= k <= num.length <= 105
# num consists of only digits.
# num does not have any leading zeros except for the zero itself.


class Solution:
    def removeKdigits(self, num: str, k: int) -> str:
        stack = []

        for c in num:
            while k > 0 and stack and stack[-1] > c:
                k-=1
                stack.pop()
                
            stack.append(c)
        print(stack)
        stack = stack[:len(stack) - k]
        return ''.join(stack).lstrip("0") or "0"
