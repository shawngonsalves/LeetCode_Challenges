'''
Given a string s, return the length of the longest substring between two equal characters, excluding the two characters. If there is no such substring return -1.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "aa"
Output: 0
Explanation: The optimal substring here is an empty substring between the two 'a's.
Example 2:

Input: s = "abca"
Output: 2
Explanation: The optimal substring here is "bc".
Example 3:

Input: s = "cbzxy"
Output: -1
Explanation: There are no characters that appear twice in s.
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 300
s contains only lowercase English letters.
'''

class Solution:
    def maxLengthBetweenEqualCharacters(self, s: str) -> int:
        # char -> firstindex
        char_index = {}
        res = -1

        for i, c in enumerate(s):
            if c in char_index:
                res = max(res, i - char_index[c] - 1)
            else:
                char_index[c] = i

        return res
