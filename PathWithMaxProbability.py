# You are given an undirected weighted graph of n nodes (0-indexed), represented by an edge list where edges[i] = [a, b] is an undirected edge connecting the nodes a and b with a probability of success of traversing that edge succProb[i].

# Given two nodes start and end, find the path with the maximum probability of success to go from start to end and return its success probability.

# If there is no path from start to end, return 0. Your answer will be accepted if it differs from the correct answer by at most 1e-5.

 

# Example 1:



# Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[0,2]], succProb = [0.5,0.5,0.2], start = 0, end = 2
# Output: 0.25000
# Explanation: There are two paths from start to end, one having a probability of success = 0.2 and the other has 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25.
# Example 2:



# Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[0,2]], succProb = [0.5,0.5,0.3], start = 0, end = 2
# Output: 0.30000
# Example 3:



# Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1]], succProb = [0.5], start = 0, end = 2
# Output: 0.00000
# Explanation: There is no path between 0 and 2.
 

# Constraints:

# 2 <= n <= 10^4
# 0 <= start, end < n
# start != end
# 0 <= a, b < n
# a != b
# 0 <= succProb.length == edges.length <= 2*10^4
# 0 <= succProb[i] <= 1
# There is at most one edge between every two nodes.
