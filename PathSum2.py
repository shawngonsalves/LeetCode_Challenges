'''
Given the root of a binary tree and an integer targetSum, 
return all root-to-leaf paths where each path's sum equals targetSum.

A leaf is a node with no children.

 

Example 1:


Input: root = [5,4,8,11,null,13,4,7,2,null,null,5,1], targetSum = 22
Output: [[5,4,11,2],[5,8,4,5]]
Example 2:


Input: root = [1,2,3], targetSum = 5
Output: []
Example 3:

Input: root = [1,2], targetSum = 0
Output: []
